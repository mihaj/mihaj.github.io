At heart I am a deeply analytical person with strong passion for problem solving. I invest a lot of time in reading and learning new skills.

From the application usability standpoint, I like the UX principles of Steve Krug which were greatly described in his book "Don't make me think".

I am passionate about **Domain-Driven Design**, **Clean architecture** and strongly support discipline of **software testing**.

I have strong experience in Microsoft stack, and have developed many solutions with **Microsoft .NET** and **Azure**. Including, `ASP.NET`, `C#`, `MVC`, `.NET Core 2.x-3.x`, `.NET 5`, `.NET 6`, `SQL Server`, `Azure DevOps`, `Visual Studio App Center`.

I am a certified Microsoft **MCP**, [MCSD App Builder](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/46cb2f06-64f1-4784-b321-2dd3c092d2b8), [Azure Developer Associate](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/adc48026-470d-47a8-a766-cbe192904957) and [Azure DevOps engineer](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/671077ef-4b52-4b5c-ba5a-8bed04819678).

### D. Tools Archive

I created many more tools which were created either: for private use; for testing purposes; or for clients, and are therefore not included below.

**Registry Tweaker**

This was mine first big development project in 2005. This registry management tool was coded using Delphi. It contained a registry browser, a database of registry tweaks (in 2005 being able to tweak PC performance was of major significance), registry backup / restore, system info and much more. It was a very popular tool in 2006.

[**Google Chrome backup**](https://googlechromebackup.com)

When the Google Chrome browser was released in 2008 I made a tool called Google Chrome backup which was instantly adopted. The tool handled GC profiles, backups, run switches, multiple profiles etc. During 2009 I released several upgrades. The program is no longer updated, but is still being downloaded for use. There have been more than 70,000 downloads.

[**Path Scanner**](https://pathscanner.com)

This tool was built in order to scan the hard drive for files and folders and specifically detect file paths that are too long. This is an important issue because certain processes such as burning a CD/DVD, syncronizing files etc encounter problems where paths are longer than 255 chars. This tool also supports mass renaming of files and folders. Later I also created a command line version of the tool, which was very well accepted and is still in use today (and it's faster too).

[**RT Scan Tool**](http://www.parhelia-tools.com/products/rtst/Rtst.aspx)

This was a later development following Registry Tweaker. Unlike the earlier tool, which was coded in Delphi, this later addition uses C#. I created this RT scan tool to search and remove certain keys and values from the registry. Its purpose is to remove any residues from applications that have been uninstalled from Windows.

[**Password Policy manager**](http://www.parhelia-tools.com/products/ppm/ppm.aspx)

Password policy manager for Windows 2008, which did not include this option. The application helps with setting password policies throughout domains, users, and groups. PSO can be created and applied to Active directory object, LDF file generation, and AD search.

[**Proxee**](http://www.parhelia-tools.com/products/proxee/Proxee.aspx)

The intention behind Proxee was to handle the Web Proxy server settings in Windows OS. It includes some attractive features, like Autosense, which automatically detects which network a device is connected to and applies the appropriate profile. Although less well accepted than some other tools, the creation of this product enabled me to learn useful tips to apply to other projects I was working on or has since developed.
