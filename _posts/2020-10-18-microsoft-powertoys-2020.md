I don't remember using `PowerToys` in the past much. `PowerToys` are a set of utilites and tools that can enhance your Windows Experience.

From all the tools I am mostly using `FancyZones` and `PowerToys Run`.

FancyZones are helpful to split your screen to multiple zones and help with multitasking. To set it up press `Win + ~` and to put a window in a zone, press `Shift` and drag and drop the window into zone.

`PowerToys Run` is a global search for all the items in your Windows Seearch Index. Just press `Alt + Space` and start searching!

In October 2020 PowerToys include:
- Color Picker
- FancyZones
- File Explorer Add-ons
- Image Resizer
- Keyboard Manager
- PowerRename
- PowerToys Run
- Shortcut Guide
- Video Conference Mute (Experimental)

Currently you can install them from [Github](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys).
