[Aino Vonge Corry](https://metadeveloper.com/) wrote a great book [Restrospectives Anti-pattern](https://metadeveloper.com/retrospective-antipatterns/).

Aino writes about retrospective meetings and gives us the "medicine" to see through the problems and issues and make them gradually better. Her writing is clear and to the point. She also compares the regular in-life retrospective with the online retrospective for each anti-pattern, which is very useful in the Covid19 crisis.

[Retrospective Anti-patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Retrospectives-Antipatterns-Aino-Corry/dp/013682336X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=retrospective+antipatterns&qid=1608458722&sr=8-1) is one of my favorite books on the subject, and it's my go-to resource! Great work, Aino :)!
