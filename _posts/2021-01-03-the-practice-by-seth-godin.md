I love books by [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/). Books like **The Linchpin**, **Tribes** or **The Dip**. Seth always explains things in a way that immediately hits you. It's common sense, or is it? 

I like that his books are condensed and give you a lot to think about life, yourself, work, passions, etc.

At the beginning of November, a new book came out. It's called [The Practice - Shipping Creative Work](https://seths.blog/thepractice/). It's another stellar piece of work that will give you motivation and ideas to push you beyond your limits. If you want to start or improve your "practice", you will love this book. Please give yourself a treat :).
